<p>Recently, during a visit to Panuval bookstore in Chennai, I came across a book by Jeyamohan, an author whose works I hadn't explored before. While I had never felt a particular fascination for Jeyamohan's writings, I decided to take a leap of faith and chose to delve into his world. I picked up two of his works, &quot;Iravu&quot; (Nights) and &quot;Yaanai Doctor&quot; (The Elephant Doctor).</p>

    <h3><a href="https://thekafkaa.online/blog/killing-commendatore/">Resurgence through Reading: My Journey with Haruki Murakami and &#x27;Killing Commendatore&#x27;</a></h3>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

<p>I still vividly recall the exhilaration and sense of accomplishment that coursed through me when I completed my very first book. It was the work of Haruki Murakami that guided me on this literary journey. Without him, I doubt I would have developed the habit of reading. Everyone has an author who holds a special place in their heart; however, I'm not one to fawn over authors themselves, but rather the content they create. Yet, Murakami's influence on instilling this reading habit in me makes me feel indebted to him.</p>
